```
  # go to Sketch.app's application support folder
  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/

  # move the Plugins folder to an easier to access spot
  mv Plugins/ ~/path/to/new-folder

  # create a symlink so Sketch.app can find the new folder
  ln -s ~/path/to/new-folder Plugins
```
