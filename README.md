My Sketch plugins and potentially some config / settings.


```
  # go to Sketch.app's application support folder
  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/
  
  # delete (or move / rename) default folder
  rm -rf Plugins/
  
  # create a symlink so Sketch.app can find the new synced folder
  ln -s ~/path/to/repo/folder/Plugins Plugins
```
